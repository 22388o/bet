Solving mental poker using blockchain is one of the toughest problems to solve in web3 decentralized space. To solve problems like these we need to address the blockchain trilemma. 

In our case we developed the layer2 infrastructure(a.k.a bet) which communicates with chips blockchain over a lightning network for fast, secure and scalable transactions.

Even though we addressed the blockchain trilemma, we lack the user experience part. The possible ways to improve the UX is to either to develop a webapp where users can play poker without any setup or to develop native desktop app.

We discuss the tradeoffs in launching poker using web and desktop apps. Before we jump into exploring the possible solutions to improve the UX, let's take a look into the existing flow diagram of Poker and then we discuss the pain points for the end user in playing the poker using the existing approach. 

In the following flow diagram we showcased only one dealer and cashier node for simplicity.
