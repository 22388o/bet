# Server setup for the backend

*
* Please be aware this setup is a temporary measure while we are working on an easy to run installation, which will also support decentalization.

This example uses Digital Ocean. 

You can sign up to Digital Ocean using this link - https://m.do.co/c/9492bae9fc3c It is a referral link and if you use it, it will give you $100 Digital Ocean credit and considering the droplet you need for this setup is about $20 per month you can have 5 free months. I in return will receive $25 and that will pay for my CHIPS server for the month.

For this tutorial we are going to setup a droplet with the following configuration:
Ubuntu 18.04 x 64
RAM: 4GB
SSD: 80GB



You need to register on Digital Ocean and once you are through and have your panel open choose Create a droplet.
